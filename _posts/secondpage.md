# Hello

sdfsdfsdf

### Math here

12345c

Depending on the values of $R_1$ and $R_2$, the voltage at the mid point will be different. Lucky for us, it is very intuitive. If $R_1$ and $R_2$ are equal, that means half the resistance is above the midpoint and half the resistance is below the midpoint. In that case, by the time we travel halfway along the full resistance (all the way to the midpoint), half the voltage will be gone. So the voltage at the midpoint would be $\frac{V_{dd}}{2}$. If instead $R_1$ was 1% of $R$, then the voltage at the midpoint would be 99% of $V_{dd}$ because only 1% of the voltage drop has occurred by the time we travel 1% of the way across the total resistance.
